Notes as of July 19th 3am:

Here are some cool things I have learned during the React Fashion Blog Project

1. Navigation Bar and Link
-Link is a way you create hyperlinks by just using the text without applying href to the attribute
-Before using though, you must import in on top of the component from the react DOM

!!! Seems a though I am being too fancy on this one. I tried to connect the nav to the react DOM in order for the 
sites to switch,and I was running into issues. For the sake of time, I will continue with the basic a ref format. Hopefully I can 
learn about this method in the future.

2. Images
Here is a great resource on images, the breakdown of types
Explains how while you can put images directly in a public file, it does not preform as well if directly inserted
Also, when you insert an image into a file, it gets added to the public file anyways.

Where I have left off:
I am having issues with page redirection. Although it seems like it is not needed forthe assignment, I am curious 
about accomplishing this, since we will have to learn it eventually anyways. The hyperlink at the top actually changes. 
So it may actully be my html or another element of my pages other than how I actually redirected it that is the issue. 

The next thing I want to start working after that, is inserting my photos. I can either do inline text with curly brackets and 
insert the image, or I can create a seperate component. I can put the images in an array or just directly insert the images. While this
is definately more work up front, if i plan on reusuing this site, it would potentially be more effecient
